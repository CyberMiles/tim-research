[EOSIO Dawn 3.0 and Dawn 4.0]

Disclaimer: this document is provided "as is". The information is derived from a variety of places and can be subject to my own understanding which may not be fully formed due to the fact that software libraries, technologies, executable programs as well as projects and their documentation are constantly evolving. This document originally provided first impressions of EOSIO Dawn 3.0. It has been upgaded slightly as we witness the release of EOSIO DAWN 4.0 and the inevitable open source code release (only) of EOSIO 1.0, by BlockOne. The information in this document is derived from the EOSIO MIT Licensed GitHub documentation and code. The ideas and conclusions in this document are based on the actual results of first hand implementation and testing of the EOSIO software as well as transcripts of indepth interviews from organisations such as EOS Go and others. In many cases real code examples are provided, and as such, the verbose content (outputs from my installation, configuration and scripts etc) can be found in the appendicies.

== Executive summary
EOS claims to be the most powerful infrastructure for decentralized applications. It has many proposed strenghts and the development, discussion and community activity within EOS is looking extremely promising and genuine.

The EOSIO open source code base is due to be released by BlockOne, on or around the 1st or 2nd of June 2018. At present EOS Dawn 3.0 and EOS Dawn 4.0 (precursors to the main launch) are demonstrating that a lot of the proposed strengths are still under active development. It is unclear, probably unlikely, that all of the proposed strengths will be realized in time for the June 2018 launch. Examples of this are as follows:

Parallel execution of applications (high transactions per second)::

* Whilst very high transaction per second throughput is likely to be achieve in the long term, at present testing demonstrates that approximately 1, 000 transactions per second is realistic and achievable. It is believed that this may scale up to as many as 30, 000 transactions per second. The highest transactions per second will ultimately be achieved as other functionality such as transaction scope and so forth are implemented. Transaction scope facilitates parallel execution. At present EOS does not perform parallel execution. The June 2018 release of EOS.IO software will run single threaded. It is also important to note that the software does contain the data structures which would allow for multithreaded and paralle execution. Therefore it is likely that this will take place in the future.

It is also important to note that context free actions (actions which do not depend on blockchain state whatsoever) are able to be executed in parallel. An example of this would be signature verification.

With support for context free actions, scalability techniques such as sharding, raiden, plazma and state channels can become parallelizable in practice. It is this development along with transaction scope that could enable potentially unlimited scalability and hence efficient interblock chain communication.

Interblockchain communication::

* Whilst interblockchain communication is likely to be achieved in the long term, at present interoperability between EOS chains looks promising, but interoperability between other blockchains does not seem to be practicable. This is due, in part, to the fact that transacting with other blockchains like Ethereum may result in high gas prices. At this stage the costs associated with interoperability between **non** EOS chains may negate the benefits of the interaction.

Decentralized storage::

* The EOS network manages resources in a decentralized fashion. At present, it is unlikely that EOS will provide a decentralized storage mechanism for the first main release. This may be realized later in the year and in future releases. At present token holders can however stake tokens for memory and bandwidth.

Block producers::

* The process of becoming a block producer is an involved and very public affair. Users who wish to be block producer candidates are required to respond in the following fashion. Create a Steem account, respond to 8 check mark criteria (6 publicly on the Steem blockchain), fill out an online form and also email EOS before the closing date of Tuesday May 15 2018 (at 23:59 UTC).

Governance::

* It is unclear whether issues will be encountered in relation to large exchanges being able to manipulate the EOS block producer voting process. For example, if voting consists of a stakeholder sending a transaction to a contract (casting a vote) then cryptocurrency exchanges who are custodians for stakeholders (end users) would have the ability to "vote". With no intent implied, this point relates to the fact that exchanges hold very large amounts of tokens as a whole. Exchanges have the ability to perform any transaction (as they hold the private keys). The overall point being that exchanges have been known to be targeted by bad actors. Resulting in malicious hacks in the past.

*UPDATE*
As announced by EOSGo, it is rumoured that, Bitfinex will allow those who hold tokens on their exchange to participate in voting for block producers candidates. In addition Bitfinex will support the popular EOS related airdrops.


== Overview

=== EOS 
Unlike other blockchain software releases, the creators of EOS, Block.one are not launching a public blockchain. Instead, Block.one are releasing the open source software which any third-party can use to launch their own blockchain implementation. Block.one will not be a block producer on any of the public blockchain implementations. Instead, users who want to become block producers are welcome to complete the block producer candidature requirements.

=== Only one EOS
EOS are allowing anyone to create an EOS blockchain implementation, using their software. But only one of the EOS blockchain implementations will be known as EOS. The theory is that the best software developers will gravitate towards the best EOS blockchain implementation and then ultimately that chain will “win” and be known as EOS. Put simply, the EOS community is required to converge.

=== EOS Tokens
Only Ethereum EOS ERC20 tokens which are registered (using EOS’s Ethereum ERC20 token function called “register”) to an EOS address will be valid EOS tokens moving forward. All other tokens will be irrelevant and non existent on the EOS network. EOS is migrating the aforementioned registered EOS ERC20 tokens from the Ethereum blockchain to the EOS software after an EOS Ethereum  freeze which will crystallise the relationships between registered EOS tokens and EOS addresses. All EOS tokens begin their existence on the EOS networ fully staked. This means that the tokens are locked up as a deposit of sorts which provides an equal amount of both CPU and bandwidth resources on the EOS network.

=== EOS blockchain implementations 
From that point the EOS software will be ready for anyone and everyone to implement. All EOS blockchain implementations will have the same amount of EOS tokens. This amount will be the amount that was migrated across from Ethereum to EOS after the aforementioned freeze. The relationship between EOS addresses and tokens will be baked into the EOS genesis state. Every time a new EOS blockchain implementation is spun-up, a whole duplicate market place mirroring the same genesis state will exist.

=== EOS BIOS Boot Node
The first step in instantiating an EOS blockchain implementation is to randomly initialize a BIOS Boot Node. The BIOS Boot Node is responsible for fetching the genesis state provided by the software (remember the genesis state holds the information about which addresses own which tokens). From this point the single node (BIOS Boot Node) creates the first block and also enlists 21 Appointed Block Producers (ABPs) and enstates the appropriate permissions to vote and so forth. 

=== EOS community convergence
The EOS community have to converge in order for the one and only EOS mainnet to take flight and never look back. After the official launch of the EOS software EOS block producers will prove their cooperative ability by producing 500 ms blocks and showing off the stability of their implementation of the EOS software.

=== Validation
No value can be transferred between account and so forth, until validation occurs. Validation is reliant on two things. Firstly 15% (150, 000, 000) of EOS token holders have to vote together (make a valid transaction) on a particular EOS chain, in order for that chain to become valid. Secondly a second constitution which replaces the default consitution must be created and selected on a particular EOS chain. 

=== EOS Registration
One of the block producers *EOS Authority* has reported that only around 30% of EOS tokens have actually been registered (using the Ethereum ERC20 "register" function). With around 14 days to go before the EOSIO 1.0 release, the percentage of registered EOS tokens has only risen by 20% in the last month. According to EOS Go only 13% of EOS tokens were registered on or around April 1st. As previously mentioned a minimum of 15% of tokens have to vote together on a single chain in order for that chain to become valid. As mentioned above, it is rumoured that Bitfinex will allow those who hold tokens on their exchange to participate in voting for block producers candidates. In addition it is also rumoured that Bitfinex will support the popular EOS related airdrops.

EOS Authority < https://eosauthority.com/genesis >

=== Replay protection 
In the meantime (while there are multiple EOS blockchain implementations running simultaneously) transactions on each of the different EOS blockchain implementations will be unique. There can be no replay attacks across forks. EOS is going to use Transaction as Proof of Stake (TaPoS) as their replay protection. With TaPoS every transaction has to include part of a recent valid block header. Because block headers are unique the network is able to refuse transactions that don’t include a referenced block. TaPoS also signals the network of a particular user and their stake on a specific fork.

=== Liquidity 
Exchanges allow users to trade EOS. Exchanges can not honour EOS tokens from every EOS blockchain implementation. For example it is impossible for an exchange to convert EOS from a hundred different EOS blockchain implementations to cash; they would go broke. For liquidity to be sound, there can only be one EOS; the winning EOS blockchain implementation. 

=== The success and future of the EOS mainnet
As mentioned above, the EOS community are required to converge. They do this by running their preferred EOS software and then voting for their preferred top 21 block producers. The users are able to unstake their tokens on that network if it is the first to achieve 15% of the entire EOS community's support a.k.a. that EOS blockchain implementation becomes the mainnet!

=== Testnets
http://jungle.cryptolions.io:9898/monitor/[Jungle Testnet]
http://138.197.160.74:9898/[World Testnet]

=== Codebase
EOS expect that C++ will be the best language for developing high-performance and secure smart contracts and therefore EOS plan to use C++ for the foreseeable future. There is an link:https://tbfleming.github.io/cib/eos.html[online EOS Integrated Development Environment (IDE)] which allows smart contracts to be written and deployed using only your web browser (Firefox is recommended).

=== Wallets
An EOS wallet can be thought of as a repository of public-private key pairs. There is no inherent relationship between accounts and wallets. Accounts do not know about wallets, and vice versa. 

**Warning:** It is important that you run your own keosd wallet daemon locally for security purposes. 

Whilst you can create, and interact with, a wallet using cleos, this is not recommended unless you are simply testing and experimenting on a local private network. 

=== Actions
An action represents a single operation. All transactions are billed a computational bandwidth cost. These costs are broken down to the cost associated with each Web Assembly instruction (action) which is executed.

=== Transactions
A transaction holds one or more actions for execution; stored in the actions array. Each instance of an action in the actions array has the following key value pairs, account, name, authorization and data. Executing a transaction results in a transaction hash. Receiving the hash does not mean that the transaction was confirmed, rather just that its syntax was without error (the transaction was valid). Confirmation of successful execution can be verified by inspecting the transaction history and obtaining the block number in which the transaction was included. 

The combination of actions (sent as transactions) and automated action handlers is how EOSIO defines smart contracts [4].

=== Smart Contracts
Actions can be sent individually, or in combined form if they are intended to be executed as a whole. EOS smart contracts communicate with each other via these transactions. 

=== Block producers and transactions
While a single block producer can reject a transaction (concluding that the transaction or account has consumed a disproportionate amount of resources), generally speaking if as little as one other block producer considers a transaction as valid then the transaction would be processed.

=== Accounts
Performing actions on the blockchain requires the use of accounts. Each account can send structured actions to other accounts and may define scripts to handle actions when they are received. The EOSIO software gives each account its own private database which can only be accessed by its own action handlers.

=== State and scope
An EOS smart contract (contractA) can read the state of another EOS contract (contractB) as long as both contractA and contractB are defined within the read scope of the transaction.

==== The timing of communication between smart contracts
EOS smart contracts have 2 communication modes; inline and deferred, these can both be defined within a given smart contract

Inline:: 
* Guaranteed to execute in the current transaction, or unwind
* Scope and authority is explicitly aligned with the original contract
* No notification of completion
* Nothing is scheduled for future, beyond the current transaction

Deferred::
* Execution set for a time in the future, at a producer’s discretion, but can timeout
* Able to reach out to different scopes as well as carry the authority of the contract that sends them
* Able to communicate the result of the completed communication
* Can be considered scheduled in nature, for future transactions

=== User interaction
EOSIO has a strong focus on the command line at this stage. There are a number of command line programs (executables) which allow users to interact with the blockchain, as well as associated wallets, accounts and so forth.

Programs::
* nodeos - is a server-side blockchain node component. It is located at build/programs/nodeos/nodeos
* keosd - is a component used to *manage* EOSIO wallets and their content. It is located at build/programs/keosd/keosd
* cleos - is a command line interface used to *access* wallets and accounts. cleos also invokes actions on the blockchain. It is located at build/programs/cleos/cleos

There is no inherent relationship between nodeos and keosd, this is logical because there is no inherent relationship between accounts and wallets. cleos effectively serves as an intermediary between keosd key retrieval operations and nodeos account (and other) blockchain actions that require signatures generated using those keys.

=== EOSIO Dawn 3.0 Installation
The following commands can be used to install EOSIO Dawn 3.0 on Ubuntu 16.04LTS, run the EOSIO unit tests as well as add the EOSIO executables to the operating system's path.

Installation::
[source,bash]
----
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/EOSIO/eos.git
cd ~/eos
git submodule update --init --recursive
./eosio_build.sh
----

Program availability::
Run the following command in order to make the EOSIO executables available (installation of executables in /usr/local/bin) in standard $PATH. 

[source,bash]
----
cd ~/eos/build
sudo make install
----

Tests::
To test the installation, start mongodb and then run the tests in the build directory as per the commands below. The results of the tests should appear as those in this document's Appendix A.

[source,bash]
----
~/opt/mongodb/bin/mongod -f ~/opt/mongodb/mongod.conf &
cd ~/eos/build
make test
----

The following section offers two alternatives to running EOSIO. Firstly you can start running your own single node on your local computer. Alternatively, you can start participating on a real tesnet. The first alternative of running your own single node locally is much quicker and safer (for rapid experimentation). The second alternative, which allows you to participate on a real testnet is a little more complex and has potential hazards. Don't be put off participating in a real testnet if that is what you really want. This document will help you understand the complexities and hazards and enable you to successfully participate and write smart contracts on a real testnet.

=== 1 - Running your own single node locally
The following commands will install and run your own single node EOSIO blockchain which will immediately commence producing a block every 500ms.

[source,bash]
----
cd ~/eos/build/programs/nodeos
./nodeos -e -p eosio --plugin eosio::wallet_api_plugin --plugin eosio::chain_api_plugin --plugin eosio::account_history_api_plugin 
----

==== Configuration
On Ubuntu, the configuration file (config.ini) and the genesis file (genesis.json) are both found in the .local/share/eosio/nodeos/config folder. In a production settings, nodeos will need a properly configured config.ini file in order to do meaningful work. However if one is not present, such as in this test case, the system will create one by default. The default file which EOSIO creats can be seen in this document's Appendix B.

==== Creating a wallet
The following command will create a wallet called "default.wallet" in the ~/eosio-wallet directory.

[source,bash]
----
cleos wallet create
----

To overide the location where the wallet will be created use the --data-dir argument when issuing the command as shown below.

[source,bash]
----
cleos wallet create --data-dir /home/username/my_wallet_dir
----

Creating more than one (default) wallet will require additional wallets to be named exclusively. This can be done by using the -n argument when issuing the command as shown below.

[source,bash]
----
cleos wallet create -n anotherWallet
----

The wallets on a system can be listed using the following command.

[source,bash]
----
cleos wallet list
----

Wallets created using the above commands are unlocked, for your convenience, by default. An unlocked wallet shows an asterix when listed.

A wallet can be locked by name using the -n argument as shown in the following command. Coversly a wallet can be unlocked by using the word unlock. 

[source,bash]
----
cleos wallet lock -n anotherWallet
----

Wallets have to be open (not unlocked) for any operations to take place. For example wallets can not even be listed if they are not open. A wallet can be opened, by name, as per the following command.

[source,bash]
----
cleos wallet open -n anotherWallet
----

*The wallet file itself is encrypted*, so the wallet will protect these keys when it's locked. *Remember to lock a wallet when operations on the wallet have been completed*.

==== Creating EOSIO key pairs
The following command will create an arbitrary keypair. Special attention must be paid to the fact that the public keys are prefixed with the characters EOS and that private keys must not be shared, whatsoever. 

The general use case for creating EOSIO key pairs and importing them into a wallet is to run the following command twice (recording both key pairs for safekeeping). The outputs from the following command (run a total of 2 times) will be required for the next step, importing keys into a wallet.

[source,bash]
----
cleos create key
----

==== Importing keys into a wallet
The following command needs to be run twice, once for each of the private keys which were created above. Note, the wallet which is having the 2 private keys imported into it, will need to be both open and unlocked before the following command is executed. 

[source,bash]
----
cleos wallet import oxoxoxoxoooPRIVATEKEYoooxoxoxoo...
----

==== Testing that keys were imported successfully
The following command will list the 2 key pairs, which we just imported into the wallet; evidence that the import worked.

[source,bash]
----
cleos wallet keys
----

=== 2 - Running on a real testnet
One of the most important steps, in relation to running on a real testnet, is correctly securing your wallet. The following steps will help you run your own wallet using keosd. This is very different to the steps in the previous section (which instead used the cleos command in a local private testnet environment).

In this section we will be connecting to the http://jungle.cryptolions.io:9898/monitor/[Jungle Testnet].

== Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)

== Governance and economics
One philosophy outlined during the *Thomas Cox and Moti discuss Arbitration* online event outlines that "it is not the code that is the law, it is the law that is the law". It was also discussed that a governed blockchain, like EOS, with an arbitration forum would provide an environment in which people could build businesses that thrive, while enjoying safety and security.

EOS blocks are produced by block producers. In order to become a block producer a candidate is required to publicly respond to a list of check mark criteria as well as fill out a form, post to steem and email EOSGo. These requirements are covered in this section.

*Thomas Cox and Moti discuss Arbitration* https://youtu.be/y4cZ5Z-lpfs?t=1878

=== Arbitration
As mentioned by Moti of EOS in an online interview, the issues which were not apparent during the creation of the EOS code can be handled by arbitration. Arbitration is put in place as a framework to protect the users of the EOS network. Moti also mentions that there are many unexplored issues which arise from the new context of blockchain. In addition to this the EOS blockchain is operating globally and therefore a single rule-set (one jurisdiction) is required in order to resolve any disputes. Some types of issues can be handled by the DAPP itself (for example refunding money to both parties if one party does not continue with the purchase workflow). Importantly, these sorts of in-DAPP arbitration can be pre-written into the DAPP ahead of time.

It is possible that different factors would play a part in which arbitrators would partake in which dispute resolution processes. For example, a specialized resolution may require a particular arbitrator who specializes in a particular DAPP or language.

Execution of an arbitration forum would include the block producer confirming that the arbitration ruling is valid. From this point the block producer would apply that ruling as part of their role as a block producer.

=== The EOS Constitution
As mentioned previously, in order for a chain to become valid a second constitution (to replace the default constitution which holds the basic preliminary arbitration rule-set) must be implemented on the chain. Of course having an arbitration framework in the consitution will provide room for the rules for running arbitration to take place. Some off-chain work will need to take place in order for the arbitration to properly succeed. For example, arbitrators who partake in the EOS system will need to be trained. EOS is a community driven project and therefore the rule-set for arbitration rules will need to be voted on as time goes by.

=== Arbitration vs Improvement Proposals
Other blockchain implementations such as Ethereum and Bitcoin use Improvement Proposals (EIP and BIP respectively) to address ongoing changes which arise. EOS governance (arbitration, rule-sets and the constitution) sets out to serve the community and to act in the most transparent way. For example, arbitrators have to be independant and have no conflict of interest in relation to a particular case. Just as developers who can action Improvement Proposals, EOS arbitrators require an aptitude to make decisions which can stand up to scrutiny of the community and parties who have a stake in the decisions.

Just as core developers commit code and merge pull requests in blockchain software. EOS arbitrators are required to rule "by name". This identifies the arbitor and outlines the reasons for the specific decision which they have made.

=== Centralization 
Centralization is the process by which the activities of an organization, particularly those regarding planning and decision-making, become concentrated within a particular location or group [2]. Some argue that the Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, which EOS uses, is centralized when compared to other consensus mechasisms such as Ethereum's current Proof of Work (PoW). However, others argue against this view with reference to the most recent data from PoW mining pools. The diagram below illustrates the percentage of Ethereum's distributed PoW hashing power. More specifically, how the vast majority of Ethereum's hashing power is spread across only a handful of the most powerful and centralized mining pools in the world [3].
image:images/mining_pools.jpeg[]

=== EOS Block Producer Candidates
According to *bp.eosgo.io* there are currently 156 block producer candidates, worldwide. 
Block producers are an integral part of the EOSIO blockchain implementation and infrastructure. Block producers are also known, in other blockchain circles, as super nodes or validating nodes or master nodes etc. The following section will cover the role of EOSIO block producers in-depth. For example, how block producers become qualified for their position, how token holders vote for block producers, as well as the rewards and consequences for being a good (or bad) block producer on the EOS network. Attack vectors which may threaten block producers will also be covered.

*https://bp.eosgo.io/explore/?search_keywords=&job_category%5B%5D=block-producer&tab=search-form&type=place*

==== Radical transparency
Anyone who holds tokens on an EOS network can participate in the production of blocks. Those who wish to become a block producer are required to respond to 8 check mark criteria. Moreover, they are required to publicly post 6 of the 8 check mark criteria on the Steem blockchain. This ensures that a permanent record of each candidate's response and commitment is stored on an immutable public blockchain.

==== Voting for block producers
Block producers are elected into their role through a continuous approval voting system which involves, among other things, convincing other token holders to vote for them.

==== Block producer roles and responsibilities
Block producers are randomly ordered to produce the upcoming EOS blocks; there is a fixed schedule which outlines which block producers are responsible for producing specific blocks during a given period of time. Only one block producer at a single point in time can produce the block to which they were assigned. If a block producer goes off line during this time, the block to which they were assigned does not get created. 

==== Rewards and incentives
100% of block rewards are divided up between 21 block producers. Therefore each block producer receives 4.76190476 % of the total rewards each (4.76190476 * 21 = 100).

==== Consequences and punishment
There are certain actions (bad behaviour) which will result in undesirable consequences and potential punishment for a block producer. These include, but are not limited to:
* signing two or more blocks with the same timestamp
* signing two or more blocks with the same blockheight
* being off-line (unavailable) during the scheduled time of block production
Poorly fulfilling one’s role as a block producer will result in economic loss from a) missing the block rewards for the current block and b) future losses due to the fact that they may no longer be able to convince others that they are reliable enough to hold their position as block producer.

==== Disqualification

==== Security

=== Block producer application process
Those who want to become block producers will need to perform the following. Taking special note that items 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 in the Block producer check mark criteria section below are to be publicly written up **on the Steem blockchain**.

== Scalability
The June 2018 release of EOS.IO software will run single threaded, yet it contains the data structures necessary for future multithreaded, parallel execution [6].

=== Parallel execution
Blockchain consensus depends upon deterministic (reproducible) behavior. This means all parallel execution must be free from the use of mutexes or other locking primitives. Without locks there must be some way to guarantee that transactions that may be executed in parallel do not create non-deterministic results [6].

=== How scope contributes to performance and scalability
To support parallel execution, each account can also define any number of scopes within their database. The block producers will schedule transaction in such a way that there is no conflict over memory access to scopes and therefore they can be executed in parallel [4].

=== Permission evaluation/verification performance
The permission evaluation process is "read-only" and changes to permissions made by transactions do not take effect until the end of a block. This means that all keys and permission evaluation for all transactions can be executed in parallel. Furthermore, this means that a rapid validation of permission is possible without starting costly application logic that would have to be rolled back. Lastly, it means that transaction permissions can be evaluated as pending transactions are received and do not need to be re-evaluated as they are applied. All things considered, permission verification represents a significant percentage of the computation required to validate transactions. Making this a read-only and trivially parallelizable process enables a dramatic increase in performance. [5].
