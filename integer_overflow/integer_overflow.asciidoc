== Testing safe multiplication of numbers
A Solidity Smart Contract code for multiplication might look something like this.

[source, javascript]
----
pragma solidity ^0.4.23;

/*
        Integer Overflow Testing v0.1
*/

contract IntegerOverflowTesting{
        string public version = "0.1";

        /**
        @dev    This function tests integer multiplication by allowing the caller to pass in any two uint256 integers
        @param  _a is a single uint256 integer value which is passed in by the function caller
        @param  _b is a single uint256 integer value which is passed in by the function caller
        @return This function returns a single uint256 integer value
        */
        function multiply(uint256 _a, uint256 _b) public pure returns(uint256 _c){
                _c = _a * _b;
                return _c;
        }

If I have two positive numbers 2 and 2 and I multiply them together I get 4
