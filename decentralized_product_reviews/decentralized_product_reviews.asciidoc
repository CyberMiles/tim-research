= Decentralized product reviews

== Background

One of the key advantages of a decentralized e-commerce network is the fair distribution of funds. In a centralized e-commerce environment the supplier, merchant and/or the seller generally provide the specification, description and price of a given product. As a general rule, the profit from the sale of the product is fed up the chain back to the seller, merchant and supplier.

Taking one small component of the product's lifecycle, let's ask the following question. What if a buyer was able to provide rich information about a product and its uses? More specifically, what if a buyer was incentivized enough to provide a sensational product review for any product which they had purchased on the decentralized e-commerce network?

How would this work? Here are a few suggestions.
