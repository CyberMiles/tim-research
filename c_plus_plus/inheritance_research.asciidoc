A base class, which can be inherited by a derived class, should have a virtual destructor. 
Reason for this example: To show that it is possible for the destructor of a Derived class not to execute, due to the Base class not having a virtual destructor. 
Potential issue?: This is a potential resource leak.

#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

class Base {
public:
	Base() { 
		std::cout << "Constructor of the Base class executed." << std::endl; 
	}
	~Base() { 
		std::cout << "Destructor of Base class executed." << std::endl; 
	}
};

class Derived : public Base {
    //code goes here
public:
	Derived() { 
		std::cout << "Constructor of the Derived class executed." << std::endl; 
	}
    ~Derived() { 
		std::cout << "Destructor of Derived class executed." << std::endl; 
	}
};

main() {
	std::cout << "Starting" << std::endl;
	Base* myClass = new Derived;
	std::cout << "Deleting instance called myClass" << std::endl;
	delete myClass;    // resource leak
	std::cout << "Finished" << std::endl;
	return 0;
}

/*

The above code produces the following output, showing that the destructor of the Derived Class is never executed. This is a potential resource leak.

Starting
Constructor of the Base class executed.
Constructor of the Derived class executed.
Deleting instance called myClass
Destructor of Base class executed.
Finished
