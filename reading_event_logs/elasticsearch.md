# The worldâ€™s blockchain data

Our world has numerous production blockchain networks which are transacting real-value in real-time. Examples of these exciting projects include [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/en/), [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) and [CyberMiles](https://www.cybermiles.io/en-us/).

CyberMiles is a public e-commerce blockchain which supports a global community of buyers and sellers. The CyberMiles mainnet was launched in October 2018 and since then the global CyberMiles community have been invited to create and deploy their own smart contracts and decentralized blockchain applications (DApps) on the CyberMiles blockchain.

As we will discover shortly, smart contracts and DApps generate a lot of immutable blockchain data. Unsurprisingly, the volume of this data is set to increase, as Information Technology (IT) infrastructure moves away from a traditional centralized model, and towards new and emerging decentralised blockchain architectures.

A [new wave of blockchain data](https://medium.com/cybermiles/the-next-wave-in-blockchain-data-36e45bab246) is rising and, right now, there are big opportunities for holistic off-chain search and analytics engines such as Elasticsearch to thrive in the blockchain space. Specifically, in the areas of blockchain data-harvesting, data-interpretation, machine-learning and data-visualization.

This is extremely exciting but as we will soon discover, there is a minor challenge to overcome before Elasticsearch can provide all of the aforementioned benefits to existing blockchain smart contracts and DApps.
